# ComfyUI-See-through

A ComfyUI plugin that wraps [See-through](https://github.com/shitagaki-lab/see-through) — an AI system that decomposes a single anime illustration into manipulatable 2.5D layer-decomposed models with depth ordering, ready for Live2D workflows.

Paper: [arxiv:2602.03749](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03749) (Conditionally accepted to ACM SIGGRAPH 2026)

## Features

- **Single-Image Layer Decomposition** — Input one anime character image, get up to 24 semantic transparent layers (hair, face, eyes, clothing, accessories, etc.)
- **Depth Estimation** — Automatic depth map generation for each layer via fine-tuned Marigold, establishing correct drawing order
- **Smart Splitting** — Eyes, ears, handwear split into left/right; hair split into front/back via depth clustering
- **PSD Export** — Download layered PSD files directly from the browser (frontend ag-psd, no Python dependency)
- **Depth PSD** — Separate depth PSD export for 3D/parallax workflows
- **Preview Output** — Blended reconstruction preview as a standard ComfyUI IMAGE output
- **Per-Layer Outputs** — Send every processed layer to downstream ComfyUI nodes as synchronized IMAGE, MASK, and name lists
- **HuggingFace Auto-Download** — Models download automatically from HuggingFace on first use
- **VRAM Optimization** — Tag embedding caching, text encoder unloading, group offload, and configurable depth resolution for low-VRAM GPUs

## Nodes

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **SeeThrough Load LayerDiff Model** | Load the LayerDiff SDXL pipeline (layer generation) |
| **SeeThrough Load Depth Model** | Load the Marigold depth estimation pipeline |
| **SeeThrough Generate Layers** | Decompose the input into raw semantic RGBA layers |
| **SeeThrough Generate Depth** | Estimate per-layer depth maps |
| **SeeThrough Post Process** | Final splitting/cropping with per-layer IMAGE, alpha MASK, and layer-name outputs |
| **SeeThrough Save PSD** | Save layers as PNGs + metadata; download PSD via browser button |

## Installation

Clone this repository into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/jtydhr88/ComfyUI-See-through.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd ComfyUI-See-through
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Restart ComfyUI. The **SeeThrough** nodes will appear under the `SeeThrough` category.

### Dependencies

Only 4 additional Python packages beyond ComfyUI's base:

- `diffusers` — Hugging Face diffusion pipeline
- `accelerate` — Model loading acceleration
- `opencv-python` — Image processing
- `scikit-learn` — KMeans clustering for depth-based layer splitting

### Models

Models are downloaded automatically from HuggingFace on first use:

| Model | HuggingFace Repo | Purpose |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| LayerDiff 3D | `layerdifforg/seethroughv0.0.2_layerdiff3d` | SDXL-based transparent layer generation |
| Marigold Depth | `24yearsold/seethroughv0.0.1_marigold` | Fine-tuned monocular depth for anime |

#### Manual placement

You can also download models manually and place them under `ComfyUI/models/SeeThrough/`. The loader recursively scans for valid diffusers directories (those containing `model_index.json`) up to two levels deep, so all of the following layouts are recognized and shown in the model dropdown:

```
ComfyUI/models/SeeThrough/
├── model_index.json                                        # flat layout (single model)
├── seethroughv0.0.2_layerdiff3d/                           # repo-name subfolder
│   └── model_index.json
└── layerdifforg/                                           # org/repo subfolder (matches HF naming)
    └── seethroughv0.0.2_layerdiff3d/
        └── model_index.json
```

When the loader resolves a model to a local path, it sets `local_files_only=True` on every `from_pretrained` call. This means once the model is in place, no HuggingFace requests are made — even if the upstream repo gets a new commit, the cache will not be re-fetched.

#### `auto_download` toggle

Both **Load LayerDiff Model** and **Load Depth Model** expose an `auto_download` boolean (default `true`). Set it to `false` to force local-only loading: if the model is not found on disk, the node errors out instead of contacting HuggingFace.

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. Add **SeeThrough Load LayerDiff Model** and **SeeThrough Load Depth Model**
2. Connect **Load Image** → **SeeThrough Generate Layers** → **SeeThrough Generate Depth** → **SeeThrough Post Process**
3. Connect `layer_images` from **SeeThrough Post Process** to any node that accepts `IMAGE`
4. When transparency is needed, connect the matching `layer_alpha` output to the node's `MASK`/alpha input
5. Optionally connect `parts` to **SeeThrough Save PSD**, or `preview` to **Preview Image**
6. Run the workflow

`layer_images`, `layer_alpha`, and `layer_names` are synchronized ComfyUI lists. A downstream node is run once for each layer, with the image, transparency mask, and semantic name at the same list index. Each image is restored to the full processing canvas so layers can also be recombined without losing their position. The order is back-to-front.

### Example Workflows

Pre-made workflows are available in the `workflows/` directory:

| Workflow | Resolution | Steps | L/R Split | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `seethrough-basic.json` | 1280 | 30 | Yes | Standard quality, recommended |

Drag any `.json` file into ComfyUI to load the workflow.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `seed` | 42 | Random seed for reproducibility |
| `resolution` | 1280 | Processing resolution (image is center-padded to square) |
| `num_inference_steps` | 30 | Diffusion denoising steps (more = better quality, slower) |
| `tblr_split` | true | Split symmetric parts (eyes, ears, handwear) into left/right |
| `cache_tag_embeds` | true | Pre-compute and cache tag embeddings, then unload text encoders to save VRAM |
| `group_offload` | false | Enable group offload to drastically reduce peak VRAM (allocated ~0.2GB, reserved ~7GB) at cost of **2–3x slower** speed. Requires `diffusers>=0.37.0` |
| `auto_download` | true | If the model is not found locally, download from HuggingFace. Disable to force local-only and error out instead of downloading |
| `resolution_depth` | -1 | Resolution for depth inference. -1 uses the same as layers. Lower values (e.g. 720) save VRAM and speed up depth estimation |

### VRAM Optimization Guide

**For most users (12GB+ VRAM):** The default settings work well. `cache_tag_embeds=true` is already enabled and saves ~2GB VRAM with zero speed impact. No other changes needed.

**For low-VRAM users (8–12 GB):** Try the following settings in order, from least to most impact on speed:

1. **`cache_tag_embeds=true`** (default, already enabled) — Caches text embeddings and unloads text encoders, saving ~2GB VRAM with no speed penalty
2. **`resolution_depth=720`** — Run depth estimation at a lower resolution, then upscale back. Saves VRAM with minimal quality loss
3. **Lower `resolution`** — E.g. 1024 instead of 1280, reduces both VRAM and computation
4. **`group_offload=true`** — Last resort. Moves individual model blocks on/off GPU as needed, reducing peak allocated VRAM to ~0.2GB but **2–3x slower** due to frequent CPU↔GPU transfers. Requires `pip install diffusers>=0.37.0`

#### Benchmark (RTX 5090, steps=30, `cache_tag_embeds=true`)

**`group_offload` ON vs OFF (resolution=1280):**

| Stage | group_offload=OFF | group_offload=ON |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| UNet+VAE loaded | 7.94 GB | 0.21 GB |
| LayerDiff peak (allocated / reserved) | 7.95 GB / 13.69 GB | 0.21 GB / 7.31 GB |
| Marigold peak | 2.49 GB | 0.07 GB |
| **Total time** | **138 s** | **385 s (2.8x slower)** |

**Resolution scaling (group_offload=OFF):**

| Resolution | LayerDiff peak (allocated / reserved) | Marigold peak | Total time | Min VRAM |
|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| 1280 | 7.95 GB / 13.69 GB | 2.49 GB | 138 s | ~16 GB |
| 2048 | 7.96 GB / 22.56 GB | 2.59 GB | 382 s | ~24 GB |

## Output Layers

The decomposition produces semantic layers including:

**Body parts:** front hair, back hair, neck, topwear, handwear, bottomwear, legwear, footwear, tail, wings, objects

**Head parts:** headwear, face, irides, eyebrow, eyewhite, eyelash, eyewear, ears, earwear, nose, mouth

Each layer is an RGBA image with transparency, positioned at its correct location in the canvas.
